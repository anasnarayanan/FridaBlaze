# About
🔥 FridaBlaze – Automated Frida Hooking & Script Execution Tool
FridaBlaze is a versatile and efficient automation tool designed to simplify Frida script execution on Mobile applications. It offers a streamlined interface with multiple execution modes, making it ideal for mobile app security testing and dynamic analysis.

🚀 Key Features:
✅ Custom URL Execution: Run Frida scripts directly from CodeShare URLs, enabling quick access to community-shared hooks.
✅ Local Script Execution: Use your own custom Frida scripts stored locally for targeted testing.
✅ CodeShare Search & Execution: Search for Frida scripts by keyword on CodeShare, view the results, and execute them instantly.
✅ Timeout and Error Handling: Automatically handles script execution timeouts and gracefully falls back to alternative approaches.
✅ Flexible Execution Flow: If one execution method fails, FridaBlaze returns to the main menu, allowing you to try another approach without restarting.
✅ Parallel Script Search: Leverages multi-threading to quickly fetch and display multiple scripts from CodeShare.

⚠️ Important Note:
To ensure FridaBlaze works properly, Frida must be installed on both the mobile device and the system with the same version. Mismatched versions may lead to connection failures, inconsistent behavior, or script execution errors.

🛠️ Use Case Scenarios:
🔥 Dynamic analysis and runtime modification of Android apps.
🔥 Automated script execution for faster penetration testing.
🔥 Flexible switching between local and online scripts for increased efficiency.
🔥 Easy fallback mechanism for continuous testing without interruption.

FridaBlaze boosts productivity, enhances testing capabilities, and makes Frida-based security assessments more efficient and seamless. 🚀🔥
